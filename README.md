# League of Legends Champions App

A webpage for champion data from the popular MOBA, League of Legends by Riot Games.

# Motivation

I am building this webpage as a React based project for a software engineering immersive course. I have a great passion for video games and League of Legends has always been one that stood out to me. Given the opportunity to work with APIs and create anything that I wanted, I just could not go with anything other than League of Legends.

# Features

- Search for any champion to view their stats
- Display a full list of champions
- Radar chart to display champion stats
- Champions can be clicked on to view their splash art, stats chart, lore, and abilities
